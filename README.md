# 100daysofcode
This repo contains my 100daysofcode journey as a Data Scientist and Quant developer, I will be uploading mini-projects I do everyday towards gaining mastery in the field.

*Day 1*: I worked on a guided project on DataCamp where I 'investigated' a dataset containing Netflix movies from the year 2011-2020. I performed exploratory data analyisis on the dataset to come to the conclusion of whether Netflix movies are getting shorter. 
The sole reason I worked on this was to reinforce my data analysis skills with python and the pandas library. 
After working in the dataset, I came to the conclusion that they might be a reduction the duration of movies being made but majority of the movies with shorter duration are mostly; children shows and documentaries.
